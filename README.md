# Hackathon — Local PI Style Prompt Workspace

Hackathon is a local Flask web app for building reusable PI-style review prompts from your own reference materials. It helps you create/select mentors, organize each mentor's raw materials by review mode, and generate mode-specific prompt files that can be reused for future research feedback.

The current workflow is designed for **local-first** use:

- The web app runs on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
- Uploaded files are copied into a private local `mentor_files/` library.
- PI-style prompt generation can run locally through Ollama/Llama.
- Each mentor's latest prompt `.txt` files are updated in that mentor folder every time you generate.
- Per-run copies are also saved under `outputs/<run_id>/`.
- `.env`, `mentor_files/`, and generated outputs are ignored by git.

## Main features

### 1. Build Your PI Style Library

At the top of the page, use **Build Your PI Style Library** to either:

1. **Create Your Mentor** — type a new mentor name, then generate prompts once to create the local mentor folder.
2. **Select existing mentor** — choose a mentor that already exists in your local `mentor_files/` library.

Each mentor has three PI-review modes:

| Mode | What to upload | What the app learns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Research Ideas / Meeting Minutes | Meeting notes, research ideas, experiment plans, lab discussion records | How the PI reframes ideas, grounds them in context, decomposes variables, compares mechanisms, prioritizes roadmap items, and turns discussion into action items |
| Talks / Presentations / Slides | Slide drafts, talk feedback, presentation notes, figure sets | Audience-first storytelling, title/significance framing, citation discipline, labels/annotations, visual consistency, takeaway messages, deletion of weak visuals, and concrete slide-level edits |
| Papers / Proposals | Manuscript feedback, proposal comments, figure-set feedback, paper drafts | Practical value, central claim, coherent argument, evidence/context support, figures proving claims, claim-evidence alignment, and concrete manuscript revisions |

When you click **Generate PI-Style Prompts**, the app reads **all saved files for the selected mentor**, not only the files chosen in the current upload action.

### 2. Local mentor library structure

Mentor data is stored locally under:

```text
mentor_files/
```

Example:

```text
mentor_files/
  dr-nanshu-lu/
    mentor.json
    meeting_research_pi/
      raw/
        2026-07-07_MM.pdf
      prompt.txt
    slides_talk_pi/
      raw/
        Feedback on talk slides_251010.txt
      prompt.txt
    paper_proposal_pi/
      raw/
        Figure_set_feedback.docx
      prompt.txt
    all_pi_style_prompts.txt
```

Important behavior:

- Uploaded raw files are copied into the selected mentor's `raw/` folder.
- The page shows the files already stored for the selected mentor.
- `prompt.txt` files are **updated/overwritten** each time you generate, so they always represent the latest mentor library.
- `mentor_files/` is ignored by git because it may contain private reference materials.

### 3. Prompt TXT outputs

Each generation updates the selected mentor's stable files:

```text
mentor_files/<mentor-slug>/meeting_research_pi/prompt.txt
mentor_files/<mentor-slug>/slides_talk_pi/prompt.txt
mentor_files/<mentor-slug>/paper_proposal_pi/prompt.txt
mentor_files/<mentor-slug>/all_pi_style_prompts.txt
```

The app also keeps a per-run copy under:

```text
outputs/<run_id>/
```

with files such as:

```text
meeting_research_pi_prompt.txt
slides_talk_pi_prompt.txt
paper_proposal_pi_prompt.txt
all_pi_style_prompts.txt
```

### 4. Review a document/transcript/PowerPoint

The lower part of the page keeps a simple local upload flow for:

- Document
- Transcript
- PowerPoint

This reads a target file locally and returns mentor-style feedback. By default, if no external model endpoint is configured, this feedback route uses local demo feedback so the app remains runnable without paid APIs.

## What runs locally?

| Component | Local? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Flask web app | Yes | Runs at `127.0.0.1:5000` |
| File upload and text extraction | Yes | Files are processed by local Python code |
| Mentor raw-file library | Yes | Saved under local `mentor_files/`; ignored by git |
| PI prompt generation | Yes, when Ollama is enabled | Uses local Ollama at `127.0.0.1:11434` |
| Generated prompt TXT files | Yes | Stable files under `mentor_files/<mentor>/`; run copies under `outputs/<run_id>/` |
| Feedback demo route | Yes | Returns local demo feedback when no `MODEL_API_URL` is set |
| External model feedback | Optional | Only used if you explicitly set `MODEL_API_URL` |

## Supported file formats

For the PI Style Library upload cards:

```text
.pdf, .docx, .pptx, .txt, .md
```

For the lower review-upload flow:

- Document: `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.txt`
- Transcript: `.txt`, `.srt`, `.vtt`, `.docx`
- PowerPoint: `.pptx`

The default Flask upload limit is 20 MB per request.

## Quick start on Windows

### 1. Clone the repository

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/XKfeng111/Hackathon.git
cd Hackathon
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```powershell
py -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `py` is not available, install Python 3.11+ from <https://www.python.org/downloads/> and enable **Add Python to PATH**.

### 3. Optional but recommended: enable local Ollama/Llama

Install Ollama from <https://ollama.com/> and pull a local model:

```powershell
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

The `.env` file should contain:

```env
PROMPT_LLM_PROVIDER=ollama
OLLAMA_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434
OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.1:8b
```

If Ollama is not configured, the app still runs and falls back to deterministic prompt generation.

### 4. Start the app

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m flask --app app run --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5000
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

## How to use the PI Style Library

1. Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
2. Go to **Build Your PI Style Library**.
3. Create a mentor or select an existing mentor.
4. Upload one or more reference files in any of the three categories.
5. Click **Generate PI-Style Prompts**.
6. Review the generated prompt cards on the page.
7. Open the updated `.txt` files inside `mentor_files/<mentor-slug>/` for the latest version.

You can upload multiple files per category. There is no fixed file-count limit in code, but the total request size is limited to 20 MB. In practice, 3–10 modest files per category is a good starting point.

## Refresh behavior

After prompt generation, the `PI Style Prompts Ready` cards are a temporary result view. The browser history is changed to the selected mentor's clean library URL, such as:

```text
/?prompt_mentor=dr-nanshu-lu#prompt-library
```

If you refresh:

- the selected mentor stays selected;
- saved file lists remain visible;
- the local `mentor_files/<mentor>/.../prompt.txt` files remain saved;
- only the temporary `PI Style Prompts Ready` section disappears.

## Development

Install dependencies:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run tests:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q
```

The test suite contains route, reader, prompt-generation, UI-rendering, mentor-library, refresh-behavior, and local-output tests.

outputs/                       Local generated prompt/output run copies; ignored by git except .gitkeep
```

## Privacy and local data notes

- Uploaded PI Style Library files are copied to local `mentor_files/` so the mentor library can persist after refresh.
- Generated stable prompts are written to `mentor_files/<mentor-slug>/`.
- Per-run prompt copies are written to `outputs/<run_id>/`.
- `mentor_files/`, `outputs/`, `.env`, `.venv`, caches, and temporary reference folders are ignored by git.
- Do not commit private reference files, API keys, or generated prompt-output folders.
